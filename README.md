Ever felt like the enchant command was a bit limiting?

Now you can easily enchant anything you want!

EXAMPLE: /enchant @p minecraft:sharpness 99

There should be no limits on your enchantment or where you can apply it. Except for the levels, this will be set to 0 if they are too high.

It will also display enchantments in Roman numerals up to and including 1000 (M).
